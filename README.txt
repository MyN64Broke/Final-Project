Hello
After weeks of trying to get movement working in my original maze game
(And having Unity crash several times, losing my progress)
I decided to just make Tic Tac Toe, which I think turned out pretty good.
All of the original project stuff is still included here, if you want to look
At that, but the main project, that is actually done, is the scene labelled 
"TicTacToe"
Thank you, have a great summer.
